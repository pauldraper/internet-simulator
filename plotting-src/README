This code shows some examples of how to create plots that demonstrate
the effectiveness of a TCP implementation. The plots are:

* rate.png : Shows the rate of the TCP connection over time. The rate is
  smoothed by summing all the bytes received over a 1 second window,
  then sliding this window in 0.1 second increments.

* queue.png: Shows the queue size of a router over time. Dropped packets
  are plotted with an "X" symbol at the maximum queue size plus 1.

* sequence.png: Shows a sequence number plot over time. A square box
  is plotted at each (time,sequence) pair, and a dot is plotted at
  each (time,acknumber) pair. The sequence numbers are divided by 1500
  to convert bytes to packets, and modded by 50 to wrap the graph
  horizontally.

The code includes:

1) Generation scripts:

* generate-rates.py
* generate-queue.py

These generate the rates.txt and queue.txt files, respectively. This is
artificial data to mimic traces from a TCP implementation and a router.
The resulting data is not intended to be accurate but to show how the
plotting works.

2) Plotting scripts

* plot-rate.py
* plot-queue.py
* plot-sequence.py

These generate the graphs described above, using the data files created by
the generation scripts.
